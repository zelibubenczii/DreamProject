1) 2-3 slides about CFD

2) 2-3 slides about the union of CFD and Machine learning:
	- why do they need it
	- how is that union organised

3) 3-4 the problem we work with:
	- desciption of the problemn (2d cylinder with laminar/turbulent flow)
	- what data do we use (openFoam, paraView), how is  this data organised
	- what's the plan (is to try with NN, CNN (deep learning), -> ...)

 that's it for the introduction presentation
