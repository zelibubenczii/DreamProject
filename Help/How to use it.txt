How to use it:
Basically, user deals with 3 sripts in the root folder:
First, he is suggested to produce learning set

    1) get_CFD_cases.bash - runnig it via Blue-CFD terminal, one gets folders with cases solved by openFoam, each case differs in parameters of input case files (e.g. V_in). User could set such parameters, their increment and total number of cases by modifying the corresponding line (at the time of writing this text - line 6) of the script. All output data is collected in "data.csv" folder by writing each set of outputs and inputs as one row

It's assumed that after run neural network on some geometry, user has results written as separate CSV files (e.g. Ux.csv, Uy.csv). The 2nd script is developed as a visualisation tool (so far it produces *.jpg of contoures Ux and Uy):

    2) check_NN_cases.bash - before running it via Blue-CFD terminal, user should fullfill some prearrangment with subfolders. The order of his action is supposed to be like:
        2.1) to pick up a case folder with the same input parameters like he used for Neural Network, then copy this folder in the same root folder, adding "_NN" in the end (e.g. "V_in=1.0" must get name "V_in=1.0_NN")
        2.2) to create subfolder "_CSV" in this new folder (like "/V_in=1.0_NN/_CSV")
        2.3) to put his data from Neuron Network there, e.g.  files with the following paths must be arranged "/V_in=1.0_NN/_CSV/Ux.csv" and "/V_in=1.0_NN/_CSV/Ux.csv" for the folder "/V_in=1.0_NN/_CSV"
        2.4) to run check_NN_cases.bash via Blue-CFD terminal
        2.5) to find correspoing contour plots in each *_NN folder
    
Also, user can clean the root folder, leaving only *.bash scripts, the folders "Lib" and "Help", and also all subfolders which end with "_NN". For that
    3) clean_all.bash - just run it with Blue-CFD terminal
